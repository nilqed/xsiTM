==================================
xsiTM -- clips/cool TeXmacs plugin
==================================

Build
-----
$ cd tmc
$ edit setup.h if not on Linux !
$ make
$ cp tmclips ../xsi/progs



Plugin installation
-------------------
Copy the 'xsi' folder to the TeXmacs plugin folder (local/global) and edit the file
'progs/init-xsi.scm' to set the path to the executable 'tmclips' (line 26 ff.) if
not in global path.

(plugin-configure xsi
  (:require #t)
  (:launch "path/tmclips")
  ;(:test-input-done #t)
  (:serializer ,xsi-serialize)
  (:session "XSI"))


Notes:
-- based on CLIPS 6.30 (withtout *theEnv).
-- later versions  are not compatible for the moment because 'DefineFunction' is deprecated, 
   however, it is sufficient for a TeXmacs plugin anyway. 
-- One has to adjust setup.h for '(system ...) to work, that is specify the OS instead of 'GENERiC'.
